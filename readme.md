# Meeting Slayer 🎯

Meeting Slayer – a fun, Microsoft Teams themed mini-game where you break meetings like bricks, dodge the calendar chaos, and rack up your score.

---

## 🚀 About the Game
- Inspired by the **classic brick-breaker** mechanic.  
- Meetings appear as bricks (just like in MS Teams calendar).  
- A ball bounces to break meetings, and a paddle at the bottom keeps the game alive.  
- Score = number of meetings "slayed."  
- Funny overlays, animations, and effects for win/loss states.  
- Levels:  
  - **Fresher (Easy):** Fewer meetings to break.  
  - **Manager (Medium):** More meetings, trickier layout.  
  - **Director (Hard):** A calendar full of chaos.
